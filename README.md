# SETI-pds-toolkit-julian

Source from SETI for Julian toolkit.

This source was acquired from SETI at [this order form](https://pds-rings.seti.org/toolkits/order.html) (ORDER FORM!?!?!).

It came as a file called `julian_133.zip`.  If there is some need to see the unadulterated files (assuming they have been adulterated), a commit to the `master` branch with the comment `Initial commit from SETI code` contains the originals.

Good luck with your spelunking.

## Building

This builds well (currently) using the devcontainer.  If you will install and start Docker Desktop and launch this repo inside the devcontainer, you can do the following to build the code:
```
sh makeg77.com
```
