# SETI-pds-toolkit-julian

Source from SETI for Julian toolkit.

This source was acquired from SETI at [this order form](https://pds-rings.seti.org/toolkits/order.html) (ORDER FORM!?!?!).

It came as a file called `julian_133.zip`.  If there is some need to see the unadulterated files (assuming they have been adulterated), a commit to the `master` branch with the comment `Initial commit from SETI code` contains the originals.

Good luck with your spelunking.
